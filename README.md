# Eth-Watch

## What is it?
Eth-Watch is a sleek application to view the current market price of Etherium.

Designed in WPF to be minimalist and visually appealing in every size of window on a variety of resolutions, Eth-Watch is ideal for leaving in fullscreen on idle monitors or television displays.

## How it works
All of the information is pulled from the [Coin Market Cap][http://www.coinmarketcap.com] API.


TODO:
  * Add support for the new currencies and information available from the API
  * Provide options accessible from the cog icon in the upper-right
  * General code refactoring
